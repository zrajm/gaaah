        <h1 class=entry-title>Watching Movies Remotely with Friends</h1>

        <blockquote class="entry-summary">This is a description of how to watch
          movies with friends remotely. This assumes you'll be watching your
          own media (i.e. both you and all your friends have a copy of the same
          media file, locally on your own computer). We'll be using the media
          player Mpv and Syncplay.

        </blockquote>

        <h2>Preparing</h2>

        <p>First off you'll need to install the relevant programs for your OS.
        Here are the relevant pages:

        <ul style=margin-left:1em>
          <li><a href="https://mpv.io/installation/">Install Mpv</a> (Note, as
            of June 2020, make sure that you get version 0.32.0 of Mpv, as
            newer versions will not work well with Syncplay &ndash; according
            to the Syncplay website.)

            <p><b>Debian/Ubuntu etc.</b> &ndash; Mpv is in the repos, so just
            run <code>apt install mpv</code> and you're good to go.
          </li>

          <li style="margin-top:1em"><a href="https://syncplay.pl/">Install
            Syncplay</a>.

            <p><b>Debian/Ubuntu etc.</b> &ndash; Syncplay is not in the
            repositories (at least not on 20.04, Focal Fossa). The easiest way
            to run it is to download the <code>.AppImage</code> file,
            run <code>chmod +x FILE.AppImage</code> on it and then just execute
            it with <code>./FILE.AppImage</code>.
          </li>

          <li style="margin-top:1em">Make sure you all have <i>the same
            copy</i> of the movie you want to watch, on each of your computers.
            Fetching the movie from the same source, or sharing it among each
            other with SSH
            (or <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a> if you
            happen to be on Windows), or
            using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>
            or <a href="https://sync.com/">Sync</a> might be a good idea.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Watching</h2>

        <p>Start Syncplay. Select one of the servers in the dropdown, and enter
        a username and a default room, then click "Store configuration and run
        Syncplay". Make sure all participants enter exactly the same server
        and room name (it's case sensetive!).

        <p><img src="connect.png">

        <p>After you've connected, and if everything's working it should look
        like this:

        <p><img src="group.png">

        <p>The easiest way to load the video is to uncheck the "Enable shared
        playlists" video, and then drag-and-drop the file into the Mpv window
        (all user have to do this).

        <p>The checkbox "I'm ready to watch!" is used to indicate to the crowd
        that you're ready. If you ever pause the video, then this checkbox is
        automatically unchecked and everyone is notified of who is the
        offending pauser (the checkbox is automatically checked if you press
        play again).

        <p>There's also a chat function, you can either chat in the Syncplay
        window, or &ndash; at least with Mpv &ndash; you can even chat directly
        in the video by pressing enter and then typing stuff:

        <p><img src="video.png">

        <p>Happy watching!
